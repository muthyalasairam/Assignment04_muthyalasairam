print("1. In iOS development with Swift, passing data between view controllers when using segues is commonly done using the prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) method. This method is called just before a segue is performed, allowing you to access the destination view controller and pass data to it. Within this method, you typically check the segue identifier, then cast the destination view controller to the appropriate type and set its properties with the data you want to pass.")

2. Advantages of using Storyboard for designing user interfaces
         Storyboard provides a visual interface, simplifying the layout process by allowing developers to drag and drop elements onto the canvas.
      It facilitates rapid prototyping and iteration, enabling quick adjustments to UI layouts without the need for writing code.
      Segues and transitions between view controllers can be visually defined within Storyboard, streamlining navigation flow setup.
      Disadvantages of using Storyboard for designing user interfaces:
      Large Storyboard files can become complex and challenging to manage in team settings, potentially leading to version control conflicts.
      Performance overhead may occur, particularly in larger projects, as loading and rendering UIs from Storyboards can be time-consuming.
      Achieving complex UI layouts or animations may be limited by Storyboard, necessitating additional code for customization.

3. To create a reusable custom view in Swift:
      
      Step1: Create a new file for your custom view.
      Step2: Inside this file, create a new class that's a subclass of UIView. This class represents your custom view.
      Step3:  Write code to set up your view, including any subviews (like labels or buttons) and their layout.
      Step4: Add any customization options you want by creating properties in your class.
      Step5:  You can now use this custom view in any view controller by creating an instance of your custom class and adding it to the view hierarchy.

print("4. When integrating Firebase Authentication into your Swift project, it's essential to handle errors and edge cases effectively to maintain a smooth user experience. Error handling involves checking for issues like incorrect credentials or network problems, displaying clear error messages to users, and logging errors for debugging purposes. Additionally, handling edge cases includes scenarios such as dealing with intermittent internet connectivity, validating user input to prevent invalid data submissions, and managing changes in the user's authentication status. Robust error handling and edge case management contribute to the overall reliability and security of your authentication system. Thorough testing is crucial to identify and address any potential issues, ensuring that your app provides a seamless and secure authentication experience for users.")
